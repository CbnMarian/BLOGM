             <p>Who doesn't love a naughty sounding bike? In this blog we will look at the top 10 best sounding bikes on sale in 2018. Of course good sound is subjective, but here are my favourites!</p>
             <hr>
      
             <p>
              There is no shortage of reasons as to why get a motorcycle. Some love them for the speed and thrills, while others view them as nothing more than a secondary means of transportation. One thing that many overlook, however, is the engine notes they produce!
             </p>
          
             <p>
              Though engine noises are front and center with sports cars and racing series, the same isn't always so for motorcycles. Nevertheless, there are awesome sounding bikes of all kinds. With the high rpm's, low-liter engines, and so on, motorcycles make for outstanding musical conductors!
             </p>
      
             <p>
              To bolster this point, we've gathered a list of ten motorcycles we'd buy for just the sound alone (although, there's more to them than just that)...

             </div>
      
             <p>Starting off, let's go with something basic yet universal: the Suzuki GSXR 1000. As the name suggests, it's a liter bike, and a fast one, too! For that reason, as well as the sound and appearance, tons of young riders are allured to the gixxer community.</p>
      
             <p>
              The GSXR 1000 sounds like most other liter bikes, but with a smoothed edge and rumbling after-tones. When listening to a gixxer, they almost sound like Italian supercars, or perhaps highly modified JDM legends. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it sounds like, but you get this gist...

             <p>
              A liter bike is plenty quick, as is. So, you'd have to be either insane or brave as heck to try putting, oh, say a supercharger on one of them. And, as it would turn out, Kawasaki seemed to be the perfect candidate to get it done. The result was the mid-2010s Kawasaki Ninja H2.
             </p>
      
             <p>
              The H2 is still in production today, though, the supply is limited. Even with a price-tag of ~$29,000, customers are biting at the bit to get their hands on a 300+ horsepower beast! All that power makes a unique tune, too. The noise is much more harsh and sharp than most other bikes of its class, but that's natural given the power output and forced-induction. So, if you've got the guts (and the dough), give the updated H2 a try!

             <p>
              Speaking of the Kawasaki H2, why don't we look back at the newbie's predecessor: the 1972 - 1975 Kawasaki H2 Mach IV (also known as the 'H2 750'). Unlike the new H2, the classic is no superbike, rather, it's an old cruiser fitted with an intricate three-cylinder engine.
              
             </p>
      
             <p>
              The three-cylinder in the H2 (colloquially called 'triples') may lack the speed of a four-cylinder, but it makes for it in pure noise. It can best be described as extremely mechanical sounding; given the vibrations from the triple and excessively high revs.

               Hard to believe that a 250 cc bike would make its way onto the list, but, if we've learned anything from our years of riding, it's to never underestimate Honda. Case and point, the classic 1988 Honda CBR250RR.
               
              </p>
            
      
             <p>
              The power isn't important when you've got a bike that acts like this one. You could be going 20 M.P.H. or 100, you'll still feel like your in an F1 car (thanks in no small part to the engine note). After all, at 20,000 R.P.M.s, that little 0.25-liter inline-four will certainly sound like one...

               Shortly after BMW's overwhelming success with their S1000RR sports bikes, they decided to commemorate the motorcycle with a 'special edition,' so to speak. It was still a BMW S1000RR, just with an extra designation: HP4.
               
              </p>
             <p>
              All in all, the HP4 is a lot like the normal S1000RR, except it packs more of a punch. Due to it being a track-only bike (excluding the handful of custom-made street-legal versions), there are no laws it needs to follow. As such, you get everything that's great about the RR, but turned up to 11! And, yes, that includes the engine sound.

               For our halfway mark, we've got Valentino Rossi's (six-time MotoGP world champion) Yamaha M1. As with almost every form of motorsports, nowadays, the vehicle is swapped out after every season; accounting for rule changes, upgrades, etc. For the 2019 season, Yamaha used the M1.
               
              </p>
            
      
             <p>
              The M1 only got Rossi to second-place twice, ending up with seventh overall. It wasn't the best bike on the grid, but it sure was a throaty one! When sat in a lineup, the Yamaha crossplane crank makes a world of a difference. It's almost worth blowing your eardrums out for!

               What do you get when you mix a beloved sportbike manufacturer with an even more well-known sports car tuner? You get the MV Agusta F3 800: a collaborative effort between MV Agusta and Mercedes-AMG.
               
              </p>
  
           
      
             <p>
              The AMG F3 800 seen above was mass-produced. However, there was a limited one-off model in 2015. Still, it's among the crispest sounds to come out of a sports bike. Thanks to Mercedes-AMG, the F3 800 has the performance of a well-rounded motorcycle with the engine note of a Mercedes-Benz AMG GT S.

              Readers, we present to you one of the most expensive production motorcycles on the planet: the Ducati Desmosedici RR, a street-legal version of Ducati's then MotoGP bike. Coming in at around $75,000, the Desmosedici is (easily) amongst the rarest sportbikes.
              
             </p>
      
             <p>
              For that 3/4 of a hundred grand, you get what many Ducati enthusiasts call the best Ducati to roll off of their production line. Its build is spot on, just like the racer, and it acts like such, too. We can't imagine a single person riding this monster, listening to the engine scream, and NOT pretend that they're Andrea Dovizioso.

             <p>
              There's a lot of history behind the Honda RC166. So much so, in fact, that we could be hear for days discussing it. That, though, is a conversation for another day, since we're primarily interested in its engine note. And BOY, does it have an engine note!
             </p>
      
             <p>
              If you were to close your eyes and listen to an RC166 do a hot-lap, the normal person would have trouble differentiating between the motorcycle and an F1 car. Then again, it's to be anticipated in a 250 cc six-cylinder. Lord knows the rpm's that bike can reach...

              Last up on our selection is the Yamaha R1 (pre-2015-facelift). Not just any R1, though, but the ones with a crossplane crankshaft setup. In laymen's, a crossplane crank is how engineers describe an elevated crankshaft; making performance and efficiency more smooth and add secondary balance to the engine.
             </p>
      
             <p>
              Using a crossplane crankshaft gives the 1,000 cc R1 a more V8-like sound (the rumble, specifically). Add that to a custom Toce exhaust and presto! The best sounding liter-bike on earth! We will say that we are a little biased, though, since the Toce exhaust looks too dang good to not install!
